*Appium is a tool for automating native, mobile web, and hybrid applications on iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. It supports iOS native apps written in Objective-C or Swift and Android native apps written in Java or Kotlin. It also supports mobile web apps accessed using a mobile browser (Appium supports Safari on iOS and Chrome or the built-in 'Browser' app on Android). Perform Appium automation tests on [LambdaTest's online cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/appium-mobile-testing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-CSharp).*

*Learn the basics of [Appium testing on the LambdaTest platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-appium-testing/).*

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you have to set up Visual Studio:

<p align="center">
<img height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109070745/180055052-c0761088-eaa1-48f3-abac-521ca8c3458b.png">
</p>

- Clone/Download the Github Repository.

- Open the Android/iOS project using the file with a .sln extension.

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-CSharp).

Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
export LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME \
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```
  
**For Windows:**

```js
set LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME `
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Upload Your Application

Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
```

**For Windows:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""
```

**Using App URL:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**For Windows:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{"url":"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk","name":"sample.apk"}"
```

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

**Test Scenario:** Check out [Android.cs](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-CSharp/blob/master/android/csharp-appium-android/Program.cs) file to view the sample test script for android and [iOS.cs](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-CSharp/blob/master/ios/csharp-appium-ios/Program.cs) for iOS.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```csharp title="iOS(.ipa)"
  DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
	capabilities.setCapability("build", "your build name");
	capabilities.setCapability("name", "your test name");
	capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "iOS");
	capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "iPhone 13 Pro");
	capabilities.setCapability("isRealMobile", true);
	capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion","15.0");
	capabilities.setCapability("Visual", true);
	capabilities.setCapability("Console", true);
	capabilities.setCapability("Network", true);

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android-config" label="Android" default>

```csharp title="Android(.apk)"
  DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
	capabilities.setCapability("build", "your build name");
	capabilities.setCapability("name", "your test name");
	capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "Android");
	capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "Galaxy S20");
	capabilities.setCapability("isRealMobile", true);
	capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion","11");
	capabilities.setCapability("Visual", true);
	capabilities.setCapability("Console", true);
	capabilities.setCapability("Network", true);

}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).

## Executing The Tests

Click the **Play** icon to run the test.

</p> -->

**Info:** Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-CSharp).
